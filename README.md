# 📌 Overview

This project simulates a production-grade cloud-native DevOps + AIOps environment focused on automation, observability, operational reliability, CI/CD engineering, monitoring, and self-healing remediation.

The platform provisions AWS infrastructure using Terraform, deploys Dockerised workloads on EC2, automates deployments through GitHub Actions, monitors workloads using CloudWatch, aggregates logs centrally, triggers SNS alerts, and performs AI-inspired anomaly detection with automated container recovery.

Unlike traditional beginner DevOps projects, this platform focuses heavily on:

* Infrastructure as Code
* Deployment automation
* Production-style observability
* Monitoring engineering
* Operational troubleshooting
* Automated remediation
* Cloud-native reliability workflows

The complete infrastructure, deployment workflow, monitoring stack, and remediation logic were manually engineered and integrated into a single production-style DevOps platform.

# 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Fully automated Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
✅ Production-style Docker deployment on AWS EC2
✅ End-to-end CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
✅ Cloud-native monitoring and observability using CloudWatch
✅ SNS-powered real-time incident alerting
✅ AI-inspired log anomaly detection using Python
✅ Self-healing container remediation workflow
✅ Real-world debugging, troubleshooting, and operational recovery
✅ Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, and remediation integrated into a single platform
